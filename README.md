# NBA-Clustering-Project
This is a personal/hobby project focused on clustering NBA players on season averages from the 2024-2025 season. The goal is to develop a clustering model which can identify different types of players whether it is something like high scoring and defensive guards or big man who excel at exterior shooting.
